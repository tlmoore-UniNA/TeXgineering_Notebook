# TeXgineering_Notebook
A lab notebook template generated via LaTeX that has engineering paper-like pages.

This notebook was essentially generated from two StackExchange answers: [Repeat blocks of code](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/489749/repeat-blocks-of-code) and [Replicating engineering computation pad](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/352100/replicating-engineering-computation-pad). Nothing more to it.

For some reason, to get 100 pages, I had to set the number of `RepeatedBlock` to 5150. Not sure why yet.
